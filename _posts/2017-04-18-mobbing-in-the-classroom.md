I've been teaching Python to a high school class over a video links as a volunteer.
We were stuck in a rut, so I decided to shake it up a little and introduce mob programming.

There are 8 students in the class, arranged in two rows.
The classroom teacher sits behind and to the side.
There is a video camera in the front so that I can see the students.
We use Skype for business for me to deliver the lessons and for the students to get one-on-one help with labs.
We use Cloud9 as our Python IDE.

Day 1

Each student was at his own desk and logged into Skype, with headphones on.
Normally, all mics are muted unless somebody has something to say.
I instructed them all to unmute.
I told the students that we would be doing the day's lab as a group and to access my shared Cloud9 workspace.
With Cloud9, everybody can edit the source file simultaneously, and we all opened the same file.

I described that we would have a driver at the keyboard and a navigator to tell the driver what to type.
I told them that the rest of the class would be the brain and that the navigator would ask the brain for ideas on what to tell the driver to type.
Only the driver is allowed to type.
I selected a driver and a navigator sitting next to each other.
I set a timer so they could rotate every 4 minutes.
The teacher would participate as one of the students.
A TA (also remote) and I were available for questions, but we were not needed.

Once we started, the first thing we did was abandon the headsets.
Skype is not robust enough for multiple people to be talking at the same time.
After that, I could hear the students through the video camera at the front of the class, but they could not hear me.
I used the Cloud9 chat or waved my arms around in Skype to tell them to rotate.

We had enough time for everybody to be the navigator and the driver exactly once.
I noticed that since the driver and the navigator were sitting close together, most of the discussion was between those two, leaving out most of the rest of the class.
When the rotation got around to the teacher, she had the students gather around her screen and the discussion was more inclusive.
In the future, I will start the navigator and the driver at opposite ends of the classroom.

A four minute rotation felt a little too long, as attentions of the brain seemed to wander at times.
I will shorten this up to three minutes next time to see if that makes it feel more lively.

We had a short retro at the end of the class.
The students seemed to enjoy the exercise, but felt that the classroom is not well configured for it.
One said that he liked it because you can progress without getting stuck.
Tomorrow we will try a variation where all students rotate through the teachers workstation while projecting the screen to the front of the room.
