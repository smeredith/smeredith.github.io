title: Android Studio is Generating Deprecated Maps Code
---

Android Studio is generating code that uses the deprecated method `GoogleMap.getMap()`.
Here I will show you how to change the generated code to use `GoogleMap.getMapAsync()` instead.

I used the "Create New Project" wizard in Android Studio to create a Google Maps Activity.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/googlemap-getmap-wizard.png)

The wizard generated this code:

```java
package org.bitmine.mapp;

import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity;
import android.os.Bundle;

import com.google.android.gms.maps.GoogleMap;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.SupportMapFragment;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.MarkerOptions;

public class MapsActivity extends FragmentActivity {

    private GoogleMap mMap; // Might be null if Google Play services APK is not available.

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_maps);
        setUpMapIfNeeded();
    }

    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        setUpMapIfNeeded();
    }

    /**
     * Sets up the map if it is possible to do so (i.e., the Google Play services APK is correctly
     * installed) and the map has not already been instantiated.. This will ensure that we only ever
     * call {@link #setUpMap()} once when {@link #mMap} is not null.
     * <p/>
     * If it isn't installed {@link SupportMapFragment} (and
     * {@link com.google.android.gms.maps.MapView MapView}) will show a prompt for the user to
     * install/update the Google Play services APK on their device.
     * <p/>
     * A user can return to this FragmentActivity after following the prompt and correctly
     * installing/updating/enabling the Google Play services. Since the FragmentActivity may not
     * have been completely destroyed during this process (it is likely that it would only be
     * stopped or paused), {@link #onCreate(Bundle)} may not be called again so we should call this
     * method in {@link #onResume()} to guarantee that it will be called.
     */
    private void setUpMapIfNeeded() {
        // Do a null check to confirm that we have not already instantiated the map.
        if (mMap == null) {
            // Try to obtain the map from the SupportMapFragment.
            mMap = ((SupportMapFragment) getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.map))
                    .getMap();
            // Check if we were successful in obtaining the map.
            if (mMap != null) {
                setUpMap();
            }
        }
    }

    /**
     * This is where we can add markers or lines, add listeners or move the camera. In this case, we
     * just add a marker near Africa.
     * <p/>
     * This should only be called once and when we are sure that {@link #mMap} is not null.
     */
    private void setUpMap() {
        mMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions().position(new LatLng(0, 0)).title("Marker"));
    }
}
```

This code uses `GoogleMap.getMap()` method.
This method has been deprecated since Google Play Services version 6.5, released in December 2014.
And for good reason.
This generated code is overly complex to support polling for a GoogleMap instance which may not be ready.
What happens if `getMap()` returns null in `setUpMapIfNeeded()`?
You are going to require more retry logic if you want this code to be correct.

I give Google credit for recognizing that their API suffered this weakness and providing `getMapAsync()` as a replacement.
If we use that instead we can do away with `setUpMapIfNeeded()`.
Here is the simplified code:

```java
package org.bitmine.mapp;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity;

import com.google.android.gms.maps.GoogleMap;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.OnMapReadyCallback;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.SupportMapFragment;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng;
import com.google.android.gms.maps.model.MarkerOptions;

public class MapsActivity extends FragmentActivity implements OnMapReadyCallback {

    private GoogleMap mMap;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_maps);
        ((SupportMapFragment) getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.map))
                .getMapAsync(this);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
    }

    @Override
    public void onMapReady(GoogleMap googleMap) {
        mMap = googleMap;
        setUpMap();
    }

    /**
     * This is where we can add markers or lines, add listeners or move the camera. In this case, we
     * just add a marker near Africa.
     * <p/>
     * This should only be called once.
     */
    private void setUpMap() {
        mMap.addMarker(new MarkerOptions().position(new LatLng(0, 0)).title("Marker"));
    }
}

```

Polling is no longer required.
Now `onMapReady()` will be called when the map is ready.

Depending on your target OS versions, you can clean this up a little more by using `MapFragment` instead of `SupportMapFragment`.

Hopefully Google will update the wizard in Android Studio as well as their code samples so people will stop using the deprecated `getMap()` and start using `getMapAsync()` instead.
