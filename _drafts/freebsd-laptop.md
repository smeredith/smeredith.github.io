title: Installing FreeBSD on a Dell Inspiron E1505
---

I have install FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE on an old Dell Inspiron E1505.
I made these notes on the process in order to help you should you want to do the same.

## Installation

This machine has a 32-bit processor and 2GB of RAM.
This machine requires the i386 installer image.
I used the disc1.iso to create a CD and installed from there.

## Desktop Environment

I installed and tested MATE, Xfce, KDE 4, and Cinnamon.
Cinnamon is too slow to use, but the others are fine.

## WiFi

## Browser

I installed Chromium and Firefox.

Chromium has a bug which make it unusable: about half the time, loading a page hangs a tab.
The only way to recover is to kill the tab.

Firefox appears to work correctly.
It is also faster and uses less memory and Chromium.

## Performance

Performance is surprisingly good.
YouTube in HD is a weak point: the machine has difficulty keeping up.
The HDD is also limiting factor.
I replaced it with an SSD and performance is even better.
