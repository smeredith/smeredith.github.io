I used to use OneNote on Windows.
It worked pretty well--I could add content easily without much thought or work.
I stopped using Windows a couple years ago, and therefor stopped using OneNote on Windows.
I can still access my notebooks via the web interface, but I hate it.
Mostly because pages take forever to load.

As a replacement for OneDrive, I use a set of markdown files, image files, and pdfs.
I keep these files in GitHub.
I browse and edit them either in VS Code locally or via the GitHub web interface.

This chage has a lot of benefits for me and I am happy to be done with OneNote.
One thing I love is the transparency and portability of the file format.
OneNote stores things in a complex propriety format that makes migrating your files very difficult.

I am not trying to persuade you to switch from OneNote to plain files like I did.
But if you do want to, these ideas might make the switch easier for you.
